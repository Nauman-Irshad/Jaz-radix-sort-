🚀 I just made a Radix Sort animation in JavaScript! 🎉

I created a fun, interactive website where you can enter an array of numbers, and it visually shows how Radix Sort works step by step! 🧑‍💻✨

💡 How it works:

I added a neat header and footer to make it look professional.

You enter a comma-separated array (e.g., 170,45,75,90,802,24,2,66), and with a click of a button, Radix Sort starts sorting your array.

As it sorts, it displays the process step-by-step and shows the result in the end! 🔢➡️

I used JavaScript to handle the sorting logic and some cool CSS to give it a clean and modern look! ✨
